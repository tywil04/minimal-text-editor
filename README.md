# Tauri Notepad

### Warning: Its only in a minimal working state

A minimal text editor 

This project uses the following:
- React for a responsive user interface (create-react-app was used to setup React)
- BlueprintJS a fantastic component library for React
- Tauri a Rust wrapper to create desktop applications using JS/HTML/CSS

The toolbar is a scrollable bar that contains settings etc. Nothing actually works on the bar currently.
